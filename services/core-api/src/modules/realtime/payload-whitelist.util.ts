/**
 * WP-17/D4 + C7-08: Field events get their own, deliberately minimal
 * projection — a cache-invalidation hint and nothing else.
 *
 * A Field event is a signal that something in the socket's scope changed. The
 * client then refetches the authoritative record over REST, where
 * `field.assignment.*` / `field.state.read` are enforced. So the wire carries
 * scope and the kind of change, and no object identity at all.
 *
 * Why no `assignment_id` / `user_id` (C7-08): the Field site room is shared by
 * every principal holding a Field visibility action at that site, and
 * `field.assignment.act` is held by every `field.operative` posted there. REST
 * deliberately answers 404 — not 403 — when one operative asks for another
 * operative's assignment, because the assignee set is itself need-to-know.
 * Forwarding the identifier on the shared channel would have the socket
 * disclose the existence and stable id of an object REST says that same
 * principal may not know exists. The socket must never be the weaker boundary.
 *
 * The cost is a slightly wider refetch: an operative reloads
 * `assignments/mine` / `state/mine`, and a dispatcher reloads the site-scoped
 * list, rather than fetching one object by id. That is the correct trade at
 * this layer. Object-specific notification needs an assignee- or user-scoped
 * room, not a wider payload on a shared one.
 *
 * `organisation_id` and `site_id` are taken from the NATS subject the message
 * arrived on — the same values that chose the room — rather than from the
 * payload body, so a client can never be told it is looking at a scope other
 * than the one that was authorised to receive it.
